Assumed:
1.The owner of the yoga batch can add more batches in future to the batch table and can manipulate as needed so thought of creating a table for the same,used the same table to show the available batches to the user
2.Made use of promises async await for processing the payment after subscribing the user proceeds with payment with the user_id and thus stores it's user_id and date when the payment was done
3.Validation of the payment can be done but for now it's not done,i.e a mail can be sent to an user that they have subscribed to the batch successfully
